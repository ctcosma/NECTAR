# Final crop datasets

#### Part 1: Generate dataset of crop interactions at ecoregion and state level ####

#NOTE: the crop interactions did not go through the same interaction prediction framework as the native plants because we do not have reliable distribution or phenology data for the crops yet. So our approach right now is to assume 1) that anyone can choose to plant any crop in any ecoregion and 2) interactions between a crop and pollinator species is assumed to occur in the ecoregion if a) the pollinator species occurs there and b) we have a raw datapoint for the interaction between that pollinator and the crop

#load all final predicted interactions (exluding crops)
allInts = read.csv("/Users/chriscosma/Desktop/calscape_2.26/output/calscape_interactions_allPredicted.csv")

#load intermediate dataset that includes crop interactions (note that it does not matter that the plant names have not been standardized back to the Calscape names, because we are not using native plants here.)
cropInts = read.csv("/Users/chriscosma/Desktop/calscape_2.26/input/ints_final_clean_withCrops_slim.csv")

#isolate all crop interactions, and keep only flower visitation
cropInts = filter(cropInts, isCrop == "yes" & interactionTypeName %in% c("visitsFlowersOf", "collectsPollenOf"))

#take only needed columns and remove duplicates
cropInts = cropInts %>%

    lower = targetTaxonName_harm,
    higher =sourceTaxonName_harm
    ) %>%

#filter out non animal-pollinated crops (these were the only two that Claude identified as having absolutely no evidence of benefit from insects for fruit/seed production)
cropInts = cropInts %>%
  filter((!cropCommonName %in% c("Corn", "Barley")))

#create a list of unique pollinators per ecoregion
