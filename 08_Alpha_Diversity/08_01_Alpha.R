#Note: since this is just the alpha summaries at the community level, for now we are keeping pollen and nectar interactions separate for bees
# Note: In version 1 of the calscape data, we counted "Confirmed" as only interactions that are confirmed in that eocregion. Now we are separating confirmed in the ecoregion from confirmed anywhwere, and Calscape can display those levels now and group them in any way they want
# Note: For now, still decided to count host and flower visitation for same species as two separate events, so int he tallies that would get 2 points. If the plant is serving two functions, should be prioritized more, is the reasoning.

# The only thing that has changed since last time is that now instead of just 1 Confirmed columns, we have split this into two levels: Confirmed_Exoregion, and Confirmed_General:

# Confirmed_Ecoregion: We have a georeferenced data point indicating that this exact interaction occurs in this exact ecoregion (note that will always be NA when region = California since all the statewide summaries are inherently not considering the ecoregion)
# Confirmed_General: When the region is one of the 35 Jepson ecoregions (not California), this column refers to interactions where the two interacting species co-occur spatially and temporally in the ecoregion, and we have a data point for the interaction, but that data point is not in the focal ecoregion. So in other words, the interaction itself is confirmed, we just don't know for sure that it occurs in this ecoregion. When the region = California, this column refers to all of the confirmed interactions that we have data points for (agnostic of ecoregion, since its at the state level)

#Metadata
#The only things that has changed since last time are: 

#(1) The categoricalInteraction column, which now has 3 levels instead of the previous 2 (Confirmed and Potential): 

# Confirmed_Ecoregion: We have a georeferenced data point indicating that this exact interaction occurs in this exact ecoregion (note that will always be NA when region = California since all the statewide summaries are inherently not considering the ecoregion)
# Confirmed_General: When the region is one of the 35 Jepson ecoregions (not California), this column refers to interactions where the two interacting species co-occur spatially and temporally in the ecoregion, and we have a data point for the interaction, but that data point is not in the focal ecoregion. So in other words, the interaction itself is confirmed, we just don't know for sure that it occurs in this ecoregion. When the region = California, this column refers to all of the confirmed interactions that we have data points for (agnostic of ecoregion, since its at the state level)
# Potential: All the predicted interactions from our model, that we don't have any raw data points for, but have high probability of occurring based on our modeling. 

#(2) The interactionTypeName column, which used to have 2 levels (hasHost and visitsFlowersOf) now has 4 levels:

#hasHost: Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) larvel host plant interactions
#visitsFlowersOF: General flower visitation interactions across all taxa
#collectsPollenOf_general: General pollen collection interactions, which only applies to bees on our dataset. Note that some of the pollen collection interactions in this column may represent specialist (oligolectic) bee species, but we do not currently have confirmation for that in our dataset, and it is just as likely that they are non-specialized interactions 
#collectsPollenOf_specialist: Pollen collection interactions involving specialist (oligolectic) bee species. These are the interactions we know, based on our data, are specific to these specialized bees. Note that pollen specialist bee species may still have visitsFlowersOf interactions, which may represent resource use outside of their pollen specialist plants (e.g., nectaring)
